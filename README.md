# -Intelligent-Robotics---Alphabot2-Pi-robot
In a 4x4 meter arena, our Alphabot Pi, powered by Raspberry Pi and equipped with a camera, recognized fruits under varied conditions using YOLOv5 and Roboflow. Aruco Markers enabled SLAM mapping, and the A* search algorithm planned paths. Obstacle avoidance ensured collision-free movement, enhancing our AI and robotics skills.
